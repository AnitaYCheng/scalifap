    <p class="center">Taught by Kathleen Blake</p>
<h2 id="description" tabindex="-1">Description</h2>
<p>This APSI will cover the College Board® Art and Design Course and Exam Description (CED) as we discuss each section and consider planning for the course to include the requirements for writing a year-long syllabus. The College Board’s policy—Diversity and Inclusion &amp; Equity and Access—will be a foundation as we consider instructional strategies that will help recruit and retain all types of students, and carry them to successful outcomes. Various instructional strategies will be discussed, experienced, and brainstormed for teaching the course, including content and skills as described in the CED.</p>
<p>We will also look into the offerings of AP® Classroom, AP® Daily, AP® Central and other resources while generating ideas of integrating these resources into lesson plans for students’ and their learning. We will look at the College Board® Instructional Planning Report that identifies students’ strengths and weaknesses to reflect on instruction in the classroom. There will be group activities as well, using the rubrics to score student samples for the two sections of the portfolio, Selected Works &amp; Sustained Investigation. The Teacher Community will be shared as a super resource for ideas, questions, and answers.</p>
<p>With the intention of understanding the students’ perspectives, teachers will experience activities and develop questions that lead them to their own inquiry-based personal, mini-sustained investigation. Studio time will include individual, hands-on, making-art that allows each teacher the time and opportunity to investigate materials, processes and ideas. Application of research, experimentation, practice, revision, writing and reflection will be the final outcome for each teacher, in order to better understand the Big Ideas of the course, including Essential Questions, Enduring Understandings, Learning Objectives and Essential Knowledge</p>
