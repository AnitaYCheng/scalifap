## Introduction
Dear AP® Colleagues,

I look forward to meeting you at the Southern California AP® US History Summer Institute. We have a full week of active learning activities, which will hopefully be both entertaining and energizing. You will gain a deeper understanding of how to organize and develop a sequential curriculum for your AP® Course that is both integrated and spiraling in skill development throughout the year.

We will spend a considerable period of the week examining the AP® Curriculum and creating student centered activities to address the historical thinking skills required. From “Change Over Time” to “Extended DBQ Analysis” activities that focus on development of historical thinking skills as well as content, we will comprehensively cover how to handle the curricular expectations. Additionally, we will examine the new exam in depth: Multiple Choice, Short-Answer Essay, Long-Answer Essay, and DBQ. Time will also be allotted for Unit design and syllabus creation for the new audit process. Helpful student activities will be presented that push your students to deepen their historical insights and that move them to a higher level of analytical writing in preparation for the AP® Exam. Technology’s incorporation into the classroom will be exhibited and websites of strong value to the class will be explored in depth.

Make sure to bring your:
- School calendar
- Laptop (or iPad)
- AP® textbook (if you have one)
- AP® Teacher resources - if you have any
- Units/Lessons you have developed if you are experienced teacher
- Download the AP® Curriculum to your desktop for easy access
- I am hopeful that the exchange of ideas and the professional connections made during this week will assist you - in reaching more students and in deepening their analytical thinking and writing skills which are so critical for their success in your AP® class.
