## Description
This workshop will focus on preparing teachers for AP® Environmental Science, both new and experienced. The course will provide a mixture of about 35% synchronous, 35% asynchronous, and 30% blended instruction. The platform will use Zoom and AP® Classroom.

Throughout the week we will explore the CED and AP&reg; Classroom to prepare students for however the next school year will look. We will balance the needs of participants for content, instructional strategies, assessment, lab activities, and science practices.

Lab activities will be demonstrated through videos made by many different consultants throughout the APES community with explanation of how each one is set up, executed and assessed. Time will be provided for each participant to have completed a pacing guide by the end of the week so they are fully prepared for next year and can spend the rest of their summer catching their breath.

There will be frequent checks throughout the week to tailor the workshop around the needs of the group with optional break out groups for those that need something different. You will only need internet access for this workshop, each lab will include a supply list but you don’t need to get the lab materials to participate in this workshop.
