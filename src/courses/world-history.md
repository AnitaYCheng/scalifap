## Outline
AP&reg; World History: Modern is one of the most exciting courses, tasked with developing apprentice historians and world citizens. The course seems daunting—teaching the history of the world since 1200 in less than thirty-six weeks—but the focus on historical reasoning skills and historical processes makes this intimidating task more manageable. It’s the Skills, not the memorization of countless facts, that matter. 

During the week, we’ll discuss format, pace, class requirements, and day-to-day structures, as well as online resources like AP&reg; Classroom. In addition, we’ll workshop some of the central areas of concern in any social science class—reading, thinking, and writing—and the techniques that will help teachers meet students’ needs.

Plus, the pandemic created some “unprecedented” opportunities to transform instruction, format, and content delivery. We will explore ways virtual designs have augmented our teaching to meet student needs while emphasizing skills.

Finally, we will look at past World History AP&reg; Exams, analyzing the multiple-choice and writing portions, to best organize our class and course around successful teaching and learning. And don’t worry—if you’re new to the course, you’ll be ready to teach it, and if you’re an “old hand,” then you’ll be caught up with any updates. It’s a great course with tremendous possibilities—it just takes time!

Participants should bring a laptop and be able to access Google Classroom.
