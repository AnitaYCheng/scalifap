## Outline
World History AP® is one of the most exciting courses, tasked with developing up-and-coming historians and world citizens. The course seems daunting—teaching the history of the world since 1200 in less than thirty-six weeks—but the focus on historical reasoning skills and historical processes make this intimidating task more manageable. It’s the Skills, not the memorization of countless facts.

During the week, we’ll discuss format, pace, class requirements, and day-to-day structures, as well as online resources like AP&reg; Classroom. In addition, we’ll work on the central areas of concern in any social science class—reading, writing, and thinking—and the techniques that will help teachers meet students’ needs.

Plus, the pandemic created some “unprecedented” opportunities to transform instruction, format, and content delivery. We will explore ways virtual designs have augmented our teaching to meet student needs while emphasizing skills.

Finally, we will look at past World History AP® Exams, analyzing the multiple-choice and writing portions, to best organize our class and course around successful teaching and learning. And don’t worry—if you’re new to the course, you’ll be ready to teach it, and if you’re an “old-hand,” then you’ll be caught up with any updates. It’s a great course with tremendous possibilities – it just takes time!
