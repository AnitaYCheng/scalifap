## Description
This Institute will focus on the Calculus curriculum as outlined by The College Board. It will include a study of four major components: limits, rates of change, indefinite integrals, and accumulation using definite integrals. We will discuss the framework for AP® Calculus as outlined by the College Board in the 2019-2020 Course and Exam Description.

We will investigate the concepts using numerical, graphical, symbolic, and verbal perspectives. Concepts and lessons that promote student understanding of major ideas will be emphasized. Each participant will receive classroom-tested worksheets programs, and activities. Special attention will be given to assessment of written student responses in light of current AP® scoring standards. Change and reflections from the reading of the new hybrid format will of course be shared.

The TI-83/84 family of graphing calculators will be used for instruction but all others are welcome and some support provided. Each participant should bring their text book (digitally is okay), a device to receive digital documents, and a graphing calculator.

## Schedule
This is simply a road map. One way to complete our journey. I will allow your input and the conversations of the day lead to tangential day trips whenever we feel the need. As calculus teachers we should be very open to tangential paths.
