## Description
Welcome! This AP&reg; English Language and Composition Summer Institute will offer teachers a strong foundation for setting up new AP&reg; courses, guidance for creating AP&reg; Units relevant to each participant’s students, invigorating ideas for energizing existing courses, and ample strategies for the pre-AP&reg; classroom. 

As a current AP&reg; English Language teacher, the workshop consultant will offer numerous strategies for improving students’ abilities to read critically and write purposefully. Additionally, participants will receive an overview of My AP&reg; Classroom (web-based resources and support from the College Board) [small cut right here bc the AP&reg; Audit is not as stringent right now]. Plus, as an AP&reg; Reader and Table Leader, the consultant will provide scoring experience on recent AP&reg; essays and practice with AP&reg; multiple choice passages. 

The workshop will be structured with many hands-on lessons to help teachers choose classroom strategies to strengthen student success on AP&reg; English skills.
