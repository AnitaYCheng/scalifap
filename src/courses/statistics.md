## Description
Welcome to the wonderful world of AP&reg; Statistics! I look forward to working with you and hope that you leave feeling prepared and excited about the opportunity to teach AP&reg; Statistics. During the workshop we will:
- Discuss the NEW Course and Exam Description for 2026–2027, including topics that are being added and subtracted from the curriculum.
- Analyze the NEW AP&reg; Statistics exam format, including changes to both the multiple-choice and free-response sections.
- Practice using various types of technology—Desmos, graphing calculators, and applets—and discuss strategies for in-class and on-exam usage.
- Demonstrate how to use resources from the College Board, including Progress Checks, AP&reg; Daily videos, the Question Bank, and the Instructional Planning Report.
- Participate in many classroom-tested activities that illustrate key Learning Objectives from the Course and Exam Description.
- Highlight important course content using free-response and multiple-choice questions from the AP&reg; Statistics exam. We will also discuss common student errors and how to avoid them.
- Explore provided resources, including tests, guided notes, projects, articles, pacing guides, and alignments.
- Discuss other important topics, such as expanding AP&reg; opportunities, the AP&reg; Audit, textbook selection, assessment, and other day-to-day issues.
