## Outline
The AP® Statistics Course and Exam Description (CED) offers a sound framework and resources for constructing quality instruction. The course is packaged into nine “Units”, each containing a wealth of specificity and detail about what your students will be expected to know and do.

At the 30,000-foot level we will review the big ideas of AP® Statistics; at the 300-foot level we will engage participants in classroom-ready materials that focus on specific thinking and writing skills necessary for success in the course and on the AP® Statistics exam.

Statistics is an active endeavor, and our activities this week will engage your students and get them “out of their seats.” The use of technology—graphing calculators, and statistical software—will be stressed throughout the week. Communication—the presentation of an effective argument about interpreting data—is an essential part of doing and teaching statistics; our time together will be spent mostly in discussion and interpretation, not me pontificating!

The sequence of statistical topics, and approximate allocation of time follows below. Generally, we will focus more on content and pedagogy early in the week, with increasing concern about the exam and exam issues as we march through the week.

## Schedule
### Monday, Day 1
#### About the CED
- **Introduction to the Course**: we will become familiar with the course framework structure (Big Ideas, Topics, Learning Objectives). The Calculator and Computer software as basic tools – statistical software (freeware!) will be provided for your use during the week and your future classroom use.
- **Online resources**: In addition to the extensive materials provided by College Board’s “AP® Classroom,” we will begin to explore some excellent resources available at the click of a mouse.
- **Unit 1**: We will analyze univariate data sets designed to highlight the numeric and graphical tools used AP® Statistics. Topics include amphibians, circadian rhythms in humans, old pottery, characteristics of coins in Roman times, and that age-old question: are snakes left-handed? The data sets are diverse and are classroom ready.

### Tuesday, Day 2
#### Bivariate data analysis, sampling techniques, and the planning and execution of experiments
- **Unit 2**: Exploring Two-Variable Data. Categorical data (Two-way tables) and Correlation and Regression (including outliers, high-leverage points, and influence). Gazelles, Alice in Wonderland, Therapods (e.g. T. Rex), the Beatles, and Lizzie Borden.
- **Unit 3**: Collecting data – sampling and the design of experiments
- **Strategies for random sampling**: Simple Random Sample, Stratified, Cluster, and Systematic Sampling. Saving apartment dwellers from noise, pedestrians from New York City traffic, and Creatures in Long Island Sound will occupy our attention.
- **Strategies for planning experiments**: The Completely Randomized Design, the Randomized Block Design. The logic in planning an experiment: Random selection, random assignment, and confounding. Clam dancing, Bambi vs. the World, Fly Fishing and Slot Machines.

### Wednesday, Day 3
#### The AP® Statistics exam
- **Unit 4**: Probability, Random Variables, and Probability Distributions. We will consider coins, dice, the Spoon Law of Large Numbers, the likeability of coyotes, the Titanic, and Athenian democracy.
- **Unit 5**: Sampling distributions: Means, proportions, etc. What is the theory, and how can we teach it via both formulas and simulation?

### Thursday, Day 4
#### The Free Response section
- **Unit 6**: Inference for Categorical Data: Proportions
- **Unit 7**: Inference for Quantitative Data: Means

### Friday, Day 5
#### Inference topics and review
- **Unit 8**: Inference for Categorical Data – Chi square
- **Unit 9**: Inference for Quantitative Data - Slopes
