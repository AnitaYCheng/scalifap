## The big picture
Zoom will be used as our platform. Almost two years of experience has led to the adaption of Labs and Activities in the virtual world that explain the concepts and keeps the participants engaged.

Participants will be asked to share their favorite labs, activities, or classroom management practices.

Resources for the course will be given and shared on a Google Drive.

The workshop will have 30 hours of instruction.
