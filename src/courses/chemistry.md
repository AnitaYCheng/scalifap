## SMART objectives
The participants will:
- prepare a calendar that is based on their school’s schedule, the length of the units that need to be covered, and a period of time to practice for the AP&reg; Chemistry Exam.
- understand the depth and breadth AP&reg; Chemistry curriculum. This will be accomplished by having a good understanding of the
CED. 
- experience numerous labs and activities that they may incorporate in their course.
- experience different pedagogies that may be used to help a wider range of students.
- understand the format of the AP&reg; Chemistry Exam and strategies to increase their student’s performance.
- discuss possible ways to reach out to students giving all willing and academically prepared students the opportunity to participate in AP&reg;.
