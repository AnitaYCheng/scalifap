## Description
Participants in the AP® Art History Summer Institute will increase their knowledge of the AP® Art History Course and Exam Description. We will take a "deep dive" into each of the 10 units and 8 art historical thinking skills.

Strategies and pedagogical techniques for increasing student proficiency in the learning objectives will be shared with specific focus on how to introduce core concepts of content, form, context, function to arrive at an understanding of "meaning".

A critical piece of this workshop will focus on how to organize the course content and pacing, using instructor’s daily calendar as a firsthand example to examine, reject and/or modify. We will also learn how to use the AP® Classroom including its many resources for each Unit and Practice Questions, Class Progress Checks and Feedback, the daily videos, and the AP® Question Bank to scaffold each of the 8 art historical thinking skills and develop lesson plans that reinforce student learning.

Participants will spend time becoming familiar with the format, sample questions and grading of the exam and look at specific free response questions from the {{ site.currentYear }} exam. Participants will be introduced to how to use the Instructional Planning Report to continually refine classroom instruction. Time will also be provided for reflection and to work on your course syllabus, pacing plans and lesson planning.

## Agenda

        - How can we build **Art Historical Thinking Skills** into your classrooms?
        - How could you assess student learning?
    4. Organizing course content and pacing – how do we "get it all done"?
        - Can we re-order the 10 Units to better serve our student’s interests and needs (and our individual strengths as teachers)?
        - How can we further organize course content into manageable classroom experiences?
        - How can we organize works within each Unit to build connections between works within a unit and between works in other Units?
    5. **Asynchronous Activity**: Investigating the course content (250 works) and classroom schedules:
        - What are the advantages to following the 10 Units in order?
        - Are there alternative orderings of course content that might better “fit” strengths in our knowledge on content and our student populations?
        - Close look at your school calendar and available classroom instructional time. Can you identify potential challenges?
6. Debrief, Question and Answers:
    - What is happening in tomorrow’s session?

### Tuesday, Day 2
1. Time for reflection and questions from yesterday’s activities
2. **Beginning the course** – The first week
    1. Introducing foundational ideas (Power Points shared)
        - What is Art History?
        - What do Art Historians Do?
    2. Learning Objectives and global content - organizing the course content into specific units that scaffold **Art Historical Thinking Skills**
        - How to present Skill 1 (Visual Analysis) and Skill 2 (Contextual Analysis) using a work of art
        - Clearly differentiating Formal and Contextual Analysis for students
        - Connecting Content and Form to Context, Function and Meaning
    3. **Asynchronous Activity**: Close look at Unit 1 (Global Prehistory), Unit 9 (The Pacific), Unit 6 (Africa) and Unit 5 (Indigenous America) (Number of works: 52) or Unit 1 (Prehistory) Unit 2 (Ancient Mediterranean) (Number of works: 47)
        - How can we develop Art Historical Thinking Skills 1 and 2 and Skill 3 (Comparison of works of art) when teaching the content in these units?
        - Is there a way of organizing works in these units into smaller groups that facilitate comparisons between works of art from these different units?
    4. Sharing best practices: A deep dive into Units 1, 9, 6 and 5 or, if you chose to follow CED order, Units 1 and 2
    5. **Asynchronous Activity**: Organization of content and pacing
        - After considering both possibilities above – and other orderings – work with your school calendars organizing course content day to day with these considerations:
        - What works require more class time to unpack
        - Building connections between works and within artistic traditions
        - Scaffolding Art Historical Thinking Skills
        - Exam Weighting
3. Synchronous: Debrief, Question and Answers:
