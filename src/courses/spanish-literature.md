- New AP® teachers will review the AP® Course Audit portal and receive step-by-step guidance to register as an AP® Teacher; in turn your AP® coordinator will be able to authorize your AP® course and your use of your AP® Classroom with students.
- Select and prepare a “ready-to-use” instructional strategy to be shared with fellow participants on the final day of the APSI. See the “Instructional Approaches” section of the "AP® Spanish Literature and Culture Course and Exam Description” as soon as it is available to you.
- Activities will be conducted as a whole group, paired or group work to simulate a student perspective, or individual time to allow for teacher processing, research, and preparation for {{ site.currentYear }}-{{ site.futureYear }}.-->
