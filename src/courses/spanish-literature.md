## Objectives
- Explore each section of the AP® Spanish Literature and Culture course and exam description, including the Unit Guides, while making connections to the course curricular requirements while reviewing the Syllabus Development Guide.
- Begin to develop a course plan by unit and topic that incorporates the full scope of the AP&reg; Spanish Literature and Culture course into your school’s {{ site.currentYear }}-{{ site.futureYear }} academic calendar
- Explore the following resources within your authorized “AP® Spanish Literature and Culture” AP® Classroom: Unit Guides, Topic Questions, Personal Progress Checks, and the AP® Question Bank
- Examine sample formative and summative assessment items to identify content and skill pairings that are the targets of these assessments; subsequently these may assist teachers to create lesson plans to reinforce content and skill connections

- New AP® teachers will review the AP® Course Audit portal and receive step-by-step guidance to register as an AP® Teacher; in turn your AP® coordinator will be able to authorize your AP® course and your use of your AP® Classroom with students.
- Select and prepare a “ready-to-use” instructional strategy to be shared with fellow participants on the final day of the APSI. See the “Instructional Approaches” section of the "AP® Spanish Literature and Culture Course and Exam Description” as soon as it is available to you.
- Activities will be conducted as a whole group, paired or group work to simulate a student perspective, or individual time to allow for teacher processing, research, and preparation for {{ site.currentYear }}-{{ site.futureYear }}.
