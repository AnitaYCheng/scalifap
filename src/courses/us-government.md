## Course description
In the workshop we will focus on four core goals:
- Developing an understanding of the core content foci of the Advanced Placement&reg; U.S. Government course

- Utilizing formative and summative assessments
- Strategizing for student success, student content knowledge, and support utilizing freely available politics and government resources.

By the end of the workshop, participants will have the tools, resources, and skills to successfully teach AP® U.S. Government and Politics.

Each day we will focus on three aspects of the course: course content, AP® course requirements (e.g., skills, syllabi, assessment) and best practices. We will take a flexible approach such that everyone’s needs are met. All workshop materials will be made available using Google Drive so that you will have ready electronic access to all workshop materials during and after the workshop.-->
