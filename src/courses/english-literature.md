## Description
This course is designed to benefit the AP&reg; Literature and Composition teacher when planning for their course. Using contemporary and classic texts, we will explore instructional strategies and assessments with equity and access as a guiding principle. During the week, we will discuss and examine topics of course and syllabi design, the AP&reg; exam, seminar approaches, poetry, short fiction, major works of fiction (novels and drama), grammar/syntax, and writing. We will work on revising and constructing lesson plans and units to support student learning. For those needing to construct a syllabus, guidance will be provided. Please bring teaching resources you want to revise or incorporate into your school year. The workshop will be largely hands-on and differentiated to the degree needed.
