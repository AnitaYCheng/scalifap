    <p class="center">Taught by Dr. Robert Coad</p>
<h2 id="description" tabindex="-1">Description</h2>
<p>Participants in the AP® Art History Summer Institute will increase their knowledge of the AP® Art History Course and Exam Description. We will take a “deep dive” into each of the 10 units and 8 art historical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Strategies and pedagogical techniques for increasing student proficiency in the learning objectives will be shared with specific focus on how to introduce core concepts of content, form, context, function to arrive at an understanding of “meaning”.</p>
<p>A critical piece of this workshop will focus on how to organize the course content and pacing, using instructor’s daily calendar as a firsthand example to examine, reject and/or modify. We will also learn how to use the AP® Classroom including its many resources for each Unit and Practice Questions, Class Progress Checks and Feedback, the daily videos, and the AP® Question Bank to scaffold each of the 8 art historical thinking skills and develop lesson plans that reinforce student learning.</p>
<p>Participants will spend time becoming familiar with the format, sample questions and grading of the exam and look at specific free response questions from the 2025 exam. Participants will be introduced to how to use the Instructional Planning Report to continually refine classroom instruction. Time will also be provided for reflection and to work on your course syllabus, pacing plans and lesson planning.</p>
